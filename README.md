# FieldStruct

`FieldStruct` provides a lightweight approach to having Ruby classes with metadata available about the attributes it holds..

# Basic

The most basic usage is for a simple ruby class:

```ruby

class BasicFriend < FieldedStruct::Basic
  attribute :name
  attribute :age
end

# Minimal
john = BasicFriend.new name: "John"
# => #<BasicFriend name="John">

john.name = "Steven"
# => #<BasicFriend name="Steven">

john.age = 35
# => #<BasicFriend name="Steven" age=35>
```
